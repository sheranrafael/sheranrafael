## SupðŸ¤™ I'm Rafael Sheran, Backend Developer
Developer with a focus on Backend and experience in Ruby on Rails. My journey includes the development of web applications, where I worked on everything from business logic and integration with PostgreSQL databases to the implementation of external API consumption for real-time functionality. Self-taught and proactive, I possess a strong problem-solving mindset and am looking for an environment where I can deepen my expertise in my area, learn much more, and deliver quality solutions.
